% functionality using some radial currents data from Monterey Bay.  The
% major functions tested are:
%
% loadRDLFile, cleanRadials, maskRadials, interpRadials, makeTotals,
% cleanTotals, maskTotals, temporalInterpTotals, spatialInterpTotals,
% gridTotals, particle_track_ode_grid_LonLat, fit_OMA_modes_to_radials,

% PROBLEM: We can no longer be certain of ordering of radials after
% temporalConcatRadials because (a) it sorts the names with unique and
% (b) if there are empties then this may disorder the list of sites (a
% more fundamental problem).
% SOLUTION: Use on-the-fly structure indexing to pick out correct
% cutoffs, masks, etc.  The advantage of this is that it is very explicit
% which parameters go with which sites.  The disadvantage is that you
% have to do each site separately.
